# tlock — changelog

Newest first. See the root [`CHANGELOG.md`](../../CHANGELOG.md) for which
release tag each entry shipped in, and `CONVENTIONS.md` §8 for the policy.

## Unreleased

- `ciphersuite.randomSigma` draws through the new `entropy` module
  (`entropy.fill`, i.e. `std.Io.randomSecure`) instead of `io.random`. Not
  breaking: `fill` returns `void`, so the signature is unchanged and still
  returns a plain `[block_bytes]u8`. `std.Io.random` is a CSPRNG whose
  contract permits a silent fallback to a weaker seed (`std/Io.zig:2462`)
  and the default `Io.Threaded` takes it, seeding from pid + wall clock +
  an ASLR pointer. A guessable `sigma` opens a timelock ciphertext before
  its round, which is the single property the construction sells, so the
  draw now fails closed. The KAT path is untouched — `encrypt` still takes
  `sigma` as an explicit parameter, and every fixture supplies its own.
