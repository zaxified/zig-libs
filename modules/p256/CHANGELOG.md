# p256 — changelog

Newest first. See the root [`CHANGELOG.md`](../../CHANGELOG.md) for which
release tag each entry shipped in, and `CONVENTIONS.md` §8 for the policy.

## Unreleased

- **2026-09-06** — Licensing: added `NOTICE` (kind `third-party attribution`). No code
  changed and no behaviour changed — the module has shipped 725 Apache-2.0 Wycheproof
  ECDSA-P256/SHA-256 vectors (`src/wycheproof_kat_vectors.zig`,
  `src/wycheproof_der_kat_vectors.zig`, 358 315 B, 330 distinct authored comment strings)
  since they were committed, and the condition has been in force that whole time; only
  the record was missing. `NOTICE` reproduces the Apache License 2.0 in full (§4(a)),
  retains the upstream copyright notice (§4(c)), states what
  `scripts/gen-p256-wycheproof.py` changes (§4(b)), and records that upstream ships no
  `NOTICE`, so §4(d) propagates nothing. All 725 rows were re-fetched from upstream and
  compared field by field before the file was written.
- **2026-07-21** — Security audit: three findings fixed, one documented as accepted (not
  defects) — part of the collection-wide audit. Byte-exact against RFC 6979's published
  test vectors.
- **2026-07-19** — Performance: gained an asm/Montgomery core (part of a collection-wide
  performance campaign that also covered the sibling `k256`/`montint`
  modules; the root changelog records no further detail than this).
