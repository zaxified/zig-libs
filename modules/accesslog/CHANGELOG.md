## Unreleased

- **2026-08-06** — Security audit: one finding fixed, one documented as accepted (not
  defects) — part of the collection-wide audit. ⚠ **This entry used to begin "Verified
  against a live capture from Apache `mod_log_config` (Combined Log Format +
  `ap_escape_logitem`) + Heroku/`kr/logfmt`". There is no such capture** — corrected
  2026-09-03. Apache and logfmt are the *format* this module writes, which is what
  `root.zig`'s `meta.model_after` says; the sentence was a template rendering a
  C-reference-implementation field as a claim of a verified capture, and the same
  template put the same false sentence in four other modules. The half after the
  semicolon was true and stays: `goaccess` 1.10.2 is a genuine live external anchor,
  and it is anchoring in the direction that suits a FORMATTER — a foreign parser
  reading our output, not a capture of foreign output. It earned its place, finding a
  real defect (`%h` carried `host:port`, which goaccess rejected on 100% of lines,
  while three in-house tests asserted the same wrong shape). ⚠ It anchors **Combined
  only**: JSON Lines and logfmt have no foreign parser and are self-tested, as
  SPEC.md §Anchoring states.
- **2026-07-22** — New module: structured HTTP access-log formatter — JSON Lines /
  logfmt / Apache Combined with rigorous log-injection escaping (untrusted
  UA/path/referer can't forge a line or inject fields).
