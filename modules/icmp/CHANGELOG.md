# icmp — changelog

Newest first. See the root [`CHANGELOG.md`](../../CHANGELOG.md) for which
release tag each entry shipped in, and `CONVENTIONS.md` §8 for the policy.

## Unreleased

- **2026-07-19** — Security audit: two findings fixed (part of the collection-wide
  audit; the root changelog records no further detail than this). Verified against RFC
  1071 for the checksum algorithm; the wire-format goldens themselves are self-authored.
- **2026-07-04** — New module: ICMP echo (ping) engine — v4/v6 codec, batched socket,
  pacing.
