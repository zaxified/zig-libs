# ratelimit — spec

Design + threat notes for auditors. Usage: see ./README.md. Attribution/provenance: see /NOTICE.

## Design & invariants

- **Layered:** `TokenBucket` — the bare algorithm, no clock/lock/allocation, caller passes `now_ns`.
  `Limiter` — per-key buckets in a bounded LRU store (`max_keys` + idle `ttl_ms`), internally
  synchronized (spinlock around a hash lookup + O(1) LRU relink — the std `SmpAllocator` pattern,
  since Zig 0.16 std has no io-less blocking mutex), clock injected via `Options.clock` (default OS
  `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`). `Limiter.middleware()` is the `router.Middleware`. Modeled after Go
  `golang.org/x/time/rate` (float balance, lazy refill, burst cap) + nginx `limit_req`'s keyed
  store — design refs only, see NOTICE.
- **x/time/rate parity:** a fresh key's bucket starts full; refill is lazy and fractional
  (`tokens += elapsed * rate`, capped at `burst`); denials consume nothing; `retry_after_ms` rounds
  **up** so waiting exactly that long guarantees the next attempt passes.
- **Fail-open by design:** `allow` is infallible — on allocator exhaustion a *new* key is admitted
  untracked rather than rejected, so the limiter never turns OOM into an outage.
- **Client-key trust policy:** default key resolution order — rightmost element of the last
  `X-Forwarded-For` (the one part of that header a client cannot forge, since every compliant proxy
  hop appends its own observed peer) → `X-Real-IP` → the socket peer address → a shared
  `fallback_key`. `KeySource.header` falls back to the same chain when the header is absent.
- **Concurrency:** `Limiter` threadsafe; the bare `TokenBucket` single-owner.

## Threat model / out of scope

Per-instance only: no cross-instance coordination — behind a naive N-instance load balancer the
effective limit is N× the configured rate; a distributed limiter needs a shared backend this module
does not provide. Fail-open is deliberate but means a determined allocator-exhaustion attack buys
untracked (not unlimited) admits, never a hard block — document this tradeoff to operators. The
XFF/`X-Real-IP` trust chain is only as trustworthy as the deployment: a directly-reachable client can
forge both and land in a per-client-but-attacker-chosen bucket (a key, not a bypass) — behind
multiple chained trusted proxies, or with no proxy at all, use `KeySource.custom` instead of the
defaults. Not an authentication mechanism, and not a defense against connection-level abuse
(`abuseguard` is the sibling for that).

## Verification

16 tests. Offline deterministic: bucket math, refill and `retry_after` exactness, per-key isolation,
LRU eviction + TTL sweep, an 8-thread over-admission race check, fail-open OOM. Middleware goldens
over the socket-free `http.Server.serveStream`: 429 wire bytes, XFF/`X-Real-IP`/API-key/custom key
extraction, spoof resistance, peer-address fallback (port-insensitive, IPv4-mapped unified, headers
win over peer). In-process integration (`router` + `http.Server` + `http.Client` over loopback):
burst → 200s, then 429 + `Retry-After`, key isolation, XFF exercised, headerless requests keyed by
the loopback peer — skips only when loopback binding is unavailable. Run: `zig build test-ratelimit`.

## Backlog / deferred

None beyond the documented out-of-scope items above
(distributed/cross-instance coordination is an explicit non-goal, not a v1 gap).

## Status

`gap · any · util · threadsafe` + deps: `router`, `http`, `netaddr` — canonical source is
`pub const meta` in src/root.zig.
